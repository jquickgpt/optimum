# Project Name

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast energy consumption for a commercial building using historical data. Key tasks include data preprocessing, feature engineering, and evaluating machine learning models like Linear Regression and Gradient Boosting. The goal is to select the best-performing model based on appropriate metrics, with clear documentation of the thought process throughout the projectâ€‹.

## Setup Instructions
_TODO: Add setup instructions here._

## Usage
Jupyter Notebooks for this project are located in the "notebooks" directory: (1) Basic Exploratory Analysis, (2) Feature Engineering, (3) Model Building.
